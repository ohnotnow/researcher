I apologize, but I am unable to access external websites or specific content on them, such as the Quora page you mentioned. However, I can provide you with general information regarding potential problems or risks associated with using infrared heating panels in homes.

Infrared heating panels have become increasingly popular due to their energy efficiency and targeted heat distribution. However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

1. Skin and eye sensitivity: While infrared radiation is generally considered safe, prolonged and direct exposure can potentially cause skin burns or eye irritation. It's essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for safe use and maintain a safe distance from the panels.

2. Fire hazards: Like any heating device, infrared panels carry a potential risk of fire if not used correctly or maintained properly. It's crucial to install them according to the manufacturer's instructions and ensure proper ventilation and clearances.

3. Limited heating range: Infrared heating is more effective in heating specific zones or targeted areas rather than large spaces. It may not provide uniform heating throughout the room, and additional heating sources may be required in larger areas.

4. Indoor air quality: Unlike traditional heating methods, infrared panels do not circulate air, which can result in stagnant air and potential moisture buildup. Adequate ventilation and humidity control are necessary to maintain a healthy indoor environment.

Overall, while infrared heating panels offer various benefits, it is essential to understand and address these potential risks and take appropriate precautions for safe and efficient use in residential settings.
